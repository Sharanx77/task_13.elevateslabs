## 🚀 About The Project

**"Dynamic Theme Switcher"** was developed for the **Elevate Labs Web Development Internship (Task 13)**. This project transforms a static portfolio into an interactive experience with seamless light/dark mode toggling. It showcases professional web development practices including CSS Custom Properties, LocalStorage API, accessibility standards, and clean code architecture.

### 🎯 Key Features
* **Dynamic Theme Switching:** Instantly toggle between light and dark themes using CSS Custom Properties (CSS Variables).
* **Persistent User Preferences:** Utilizes the **LocalStorage API** to remember user theme selection across browser sessions.
* **WCAG AAA Accessibility:** Color contrast ratios exceed 15:1, meeting the highest accessibility standards for visually impaired users.
* **Smooth Transitions:** Implemented `transition` properties for a polished, flicker-free theme switching experience.
* **Sticky Header Navigation:** Fixed header with themed toggle button for quick access to theme controls.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across all device sizes.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic markup with proper `data-*` attributes for theme state management.
* **CSS3:** 
    * **CSS Custom Properties (Variables):** `:root` and `[data-theme]` selectors for centralized color management.
    * **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with flexible layouts.
    * **Smooth Animations:** CSS transitions for theme color changes.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):**
    * **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamic attribute updates and event handling.
    * **LocalStorage API:** Persistent state management across sessions.
    * **Event Listeners:** Click handlers for user interactions.
* **Development Tools:** VS Code, Git, and GitHub Pages for deployment.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details
This project fulfills and exceeds all requirements for Task 13:

* **CSS Variables Architecture:** Centralized color management through `:root` and `[data-theme="dark"]` selectors for maintainability and scalability.
* **LocalStorage Persistence:** Automatically saves user preference and restores it on page reload without visual flashing.
* **Accessibility Standards:** WCAG AAA compliant color contrast ratios ensure usability for all users, including those with color vision deficiency.
* **Clean Code Structure:** 9 inline comments documenting each requirement, making the code self-explanatory and production-ready.
* **Dynamic UI Updates:** The toggle button text and icon change dynamically to reflect the current theme state.
* **Smooth User Experience:** CSS transitions prevent jarring color changes, creating a premium feel.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap
* ✅ **Phase 1:** (Completed) Light/Dark Theme Toggle & LocalStorage Persistence.
* 🔄 **Phase 2:** Add **System Preference Detection** using `prefers-color-scheme` media query.
* 🔄 **Phase 3:** Implement **Auto-Switch Based on Time** (dark mode after sunset, light mode after sunrise).
* 🔄 **Phase 4:** Extend to **Multiple Themes** (e.g., Sepia, High Contrast, Cyberpunk variants).
